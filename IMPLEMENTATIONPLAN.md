## Contingency Plan

If certain aspects take longer than expected, prioritize in this order:
1. Working tactile augmentation for one task (can_picking recommended)
2. Training and evaluation of models for this single task
3. Clear visualization of tactile benefits
4. Extension to other tasks or Shadow Hand

## Optional Extensions (If Ahead of Schedule)

- Implement simple 5-finger demonstration
- Add more advanced tactile processing (e.g., temporal features)
- Create interactive visualization of tactile-guided decisions
- Compare performance with varying levels of tactile resolution
